# Overview {-}

This is the reader for all of UC Davis DataLab's Intermediate R workshop
series. They are:

1. _Data Visualization_ (in development)

2. _Cleaning Data & Automating Tasks_, which is about how to clean and prepare
   messy data such as dates, times, and text for analysis, and how to use loops
   or other forms of iteration to automate repetitive tasks.

3. _Thinking in R_, which is about understanding how R works, how to diagnose
   and fix bugs in code, and how to estimate and measure performance
   characteristics of code.

The material for each series is in a separate part of the reader.

After completing these series, students will have a better understanding of
language features, packages, and programming strategies, which will enable them
to write more efficient code, be more productive when writing code, and debug
code more effectively.

These series are not an introduction to R. Participants are expected to have
prior experience using R, be comfortable with basic R syntax, and to have it
pre-installed and running on their laptops. They are appropriate for motivated
intermediate to advanced users who want a better understanding of base R.
