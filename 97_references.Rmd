This reader would not have been possible without the many excellent reference
texts created by other members of the R community. Now that you've completed
this reader, these texts are a great way to continue you R learning journey.

[Advanced R][adv-r] by Hadley Wickham is a must-read if you want a deep
understanding of R. It provides many examples of R features that are important
for package/software development.

Other texts I've found useful include:

* [What They Forgot to Teach You About R][r-wtf] by Bryan & Hester. 
* [The Art of R Programming][art-of-r] by Matloff (of UC Davis). A general
  reference on R programming, with more of a computer science and software
  engineering perspective than most R texts.
* [The R Inferno][r-inferno] by Burns. A discussion of the most difficult and
  confusing parts of R.
* [R Packages][r-pkgs] by Wickham. A gentle, modern introduction to creating
  packages for R.
* [Writing R Extensions][r-exts] by the R core developers. A description of how
  to create packages and other extensions for R.
* [R Language Definition][r-lang] by the R core developers. Documentation about
  how R works at a low level.
* [R Internals][r-ints] by the R core developers. Documentation about how R
  works internally (that is, its C code).
